Planned the work strategy with the team.
Provided meeting minutes documentation for the meetings.
Worked mostly on the back-end element of the teams setup for the routes and the schema and different functions of teams whether one was an instructor or student.
Also worked on front-end element of the teams by making a few simple buttons like join team, create team, and name team, which Ayman ameliorated and used to work on his version of it.
