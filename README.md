**Description of the project**

This project is a real estate web application designed to streamline property transactions for four primary users: homebuyers, property renters, system administrators, and brokers. Homebuyers can search for properties based on criteria such as price range and room size, while property renters can find rental accommodations. Brokers manage property listings, including adding and updating details, while system administrators oversee broker accounts, with the ability to add or remove brokers from the system.
